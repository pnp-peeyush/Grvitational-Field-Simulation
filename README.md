# 2D Gravitational potential field and trajectory simulation

1. First file "GravitationalFieldandKinematicsSimulator.py". Specify all the necessary initial information of all the 'n' bodies 
to be simulated, dimensions of space and dusration of time to be simulated. After the execution of this file all the simulated 
data is stored in lists.

2. Second file "TrajectoryPlot.py" then reads the simulation data from the previous file and plots the trajectories of all the 
bodies specified in previous file.

3. Third file "FieldRender.py" also reads the simulation data from first file and plots the gravitational potential field of the 
entire system of n bodies in the specified simulated space and time.
